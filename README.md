# Loan-Default-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This repository contains my exercise from the course Loan Default Prediction using Machine Learning on ALX BIDA, this course is written in Chapter and this repository is being updated per chapter done
Chapter 1 summary
1. Basic use case for manipulating data for the ML Project
2. Identified target variable
3. Dealt with missing data
4. Calculated ages & extracted data from columns
Chapter 2 Summary
In this chapter, we have demonstrated some techniques to carry out basic exploratory analysis
1. Specific techniques used for exploration may be dependent on both the data and its context
2. Spend some time now exploring the data further
3. Combine these techniques with your own intuition to formulate some hypothesis as to why a particular person might default on their loan
Chapter 3 Summary
In this chapter, we have performed some basic feature engineering
1. We have created a new categorical column using binning on 'DISBURSED_AMOUNT'
2. We have combined features to create new ones
3. We have performed MinMax scaling on our numeric variables
